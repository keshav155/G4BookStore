<b>Problem Statement</b>

You are about to create an online web application system for a bookstore using ASP.NET MVC (C#).
Below are the books available in the store.
* CQRS for Dummies (Book ID: "9b0896fa-3880-4c2e-bfd6-925c87f22878")
* Visual Studio Tips (Book ID: "0550818d-36ad-4a8d-9c3a-a715bf15de76")
* NHibernate Cookbook (Book ID: "8e0f11f1-be5c-4dbc-8012-c19ce8cbe8e1")

With the following functions:
* The application should list all books in the bookstore.
* The application should allow customer to search books in the bookstore.
* The application should allow customer to reserve a book in the store. It will generate a 
booking number once the book reservation has been made.
* The application should not allow to reserve a book that has been reserved by other 
customer.




### Built With

* [HTML](https://html.com/)
* [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
* [.NET Core MVC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-6.0)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have .Net MVC Core 6.0 installed in your machine. I have used Visual Studio 2022 for this exercise. 

### Setup

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. Setup database as seen in Assumptions made section of the video demonstration ( 0:14 - 0:51 ) . You will need to register at least 2 accounts where 1 of them is the admin account and one of them is the customer account

3. Add all the books by logging in to the admin account and using the 'Add a new book' option in the Books tab
